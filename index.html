<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

Q42 B.V., the company behind Kukeleku Quiz, is committed to respecting your privacy. Kukeleku Quiz' business model is based on creating awesome experiences for you—not on widespread collection and marketing of user data. This means we'll only collect data we need to deliver our service to you, and to develop it to become even better.

We only ask for personal information when we need it to provide a service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means. We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.

Our website may link to external sites that are not operated by us. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

You are free to refuse our request for your personal information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.

Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how we handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact us.
